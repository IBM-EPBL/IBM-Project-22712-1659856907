            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p>We are determined to take the entire country to no-kill by 2025. We've got the expertise and we've got
                the passion. And we've got the road map. So together, we are creating progressive new initiatives while
                growing the programs - trap-neuter-return for community cats, shelter foster networking, online resource
                centers to provide neighborhood support and more - that have already brought us close to our goal.</p>

            <h2>Saving Lives</h2>
            <p>Dogs and cats at our sanctuary and in our lifesaving centers receive all the love, care and medical
                treatment they need - be it lifesaving surgery or life-changing training sessions - to find homes of
                their own.

                And because we know a home is the best place for companion animals, Best Friends implements programs
                around the country that both prevent pets from having to enter shelters in the first place and get those
                who do adopted more quickly.. </p>

                <h2>Pet adoption</h2>
                <p>With millions of dogs and cats in shelters each year looking for new homes - and around 355,000
                    killed in 2021 simply because they weren't chosen - there's no need to buy from a breeder or pet
                    store. Best Friends is committed to removing the barriers to adoption for people who want to provide
                    a loving home for pets who need them and to ensuring the entire process is positive and accessible
                    for everyone.</p>

                <h2>Caring for pets</h2>
                <p>From adopting a dog or cat of your own to volunteering at your local shelter, you want to provide the
                    best possible care. Best Friends' resource center is a comprehensive online library where you can
                    find loads of information about pet health, training, behavior and rescue.</p>

                <h2>Love for them</h2>
                <p>Hamsters, for many people, make excellent pets. They don't require a lot of attention, get enough
                    exercise running on their wheel, and are cute, cuddly, and pleasant to hold. They can make an
                    excellent starter pet for some children.

                    Unfortunately, hamsters don't come with care instructions. While caring for a hamster isn't
                    difficult, it does help to have at least a basic understanding of what you're getting into when you
                    keep one as a pet.</p>
